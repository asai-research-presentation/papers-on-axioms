  + PDDL - The Planning Domain Defnition Language Version 1.2
  + http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mfourman/tools/propplan/pddl.pdf
  + this one still uses =:axiom= to denote axioms, and have different syntax 
  
#+begin_src lisp
(:axiom
 :vars (?i - integer)
 :context (bounded-int ?i 1 numthings)
 :implies (thing ?i)))

+ PDDL in AIPS 00 planning competition
  + https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/repository/bacchus-unpublished-2000.pdf
  + This removes axioms
  + I can imagine the critism mentioned in the paper below
    + For example, this work compiles axioms into actions

+ PDDL2.1 is about temporal constraint

* Work on axioms and its semantics

+ Axioms do not have polynomial compilation, justifies its addition as a PDDL extension

  + Compiling axiom stratification into PDDL actions is very inefficient
  + Directly supporting axioms was proved to be very beneficial in terms of performance
    + implementation is also simple
  + Maximal / minimal stratification
    + Maximal:
    + Minimal:

+ PDDL2.2 now adds axioms

  + https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/06sp/pddl2.2.pdf
  + now in the name of =:derived= predicates
  + Added constraints:
    + no duplicated parameters
      + However, old domains treat duplicated parameters as implying equality
    + after converted to NNF, no axiom should depend on the negative axioms
      + TODO: check the connection to maximal/minimal stratification

Now axioms look like

#+begin_src lisp
(:derived (above ?x - block ?y - block)
	    (or (on ?x ?y)
		      (exists (?z - block)
			       (and (on ?x ?z) (above ?z ?y)))))
#+end_src

  + TODO: does this use maximal/minimal ?

+ Implementation of axioms in model-based planners
  + needs a special care

* Recent work on axioms

+ When compiling axioms into actions was inefficient, the opposite was also true
  + converting some predicates into axioms manually

+ If so, then lets automatically find axioms
