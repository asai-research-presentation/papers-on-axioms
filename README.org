+ PDDL in AIPS 98 planning competition
  + PDDL - The Planning Domain Defnition Language Version 1.2

  + this one still uses =:axioms= to denote axioms
  
+ PDDL in AIPS 00 planning competition
  + https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/repository/bacchus-unpublished-2000.pdf
  + This removes axioms
  + I can imagine the critism mentioned in the paper below

+ PDDL2.1 is about temporal constraint

+ Axioms do not have polynomial compilation, justifies to incorpolate it as a PDDL extension

  + Compiling axiom stratification into PDDL actions is very inefficient
  + Directly supporting axioms was proved to be very beneficial in terms of performance
    + implementation is also simple
  + Maximal / minimal stratification
    + Maximal:
    + Minimal:

+ PDDL2.2 now adds axioms

  + Added constraints:
    + no duplicated parameters
      + However, old domains treat duplicated parameters as implying equality
    + after converted to NNF, no axiom should depend on the negative axioms

  + TODO: does this use maximal/minimal ?

+ When compiling axioms into actions was inefficient, the opposite was also true
